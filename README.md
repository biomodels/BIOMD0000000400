**Abstract:**   
Cardiac hypertrophy is a known risk factor for heart disease, and at the
cellular level is caused by a complex interaction of signal transduction
pathways. The IP3-calcineurin pathway plays an important role in stimulating
the transcription factor NFAT which binds to DNA cooperatively with other
hypertrophic transcription factors. Using available kinetic data, we construct
a mathematical model of the IP3 signal production system after stimulation by
a hypertrophic alpha-adrenergic agonist (endothelin-1) in the mouse atrial
cardiac myocyte. We use a global sensitivity analysis to identify key
controlling parameters with respect to the resultant IP3 transient, including
the phosphorylation of cell-membrane receptors, the ligand strength and
binding kinetics to precoupled (with G(alpha)GDP) receptor, and the kinetics
associated with precoupling the receptors. We show that the kinetics
associated with the receptor system contribute to the behavior of the system
to a great extent, with precoupled receptors driving the response to
extracellular ligand. Finally, by reparameterizing for a second hypertrophic
alpha-adrenergic agonist, angiotensin-II, we show that differences in key
receptor kinetic and membrane density parameters are sufficient to explain
different observed IP3 transients in essentially the same pathway.
